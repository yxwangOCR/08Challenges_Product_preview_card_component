## Useful tips + examples

## [Picture Element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_picture.asp)

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 992px)" srcset="desktop-image.jpg" />
  <source media="(min-width: 350px)" srcset="mobile-image.jpg" />
  <img src="mobile-image.jpg" />
</picture>
```

```css
picture img {
  /*Image Style Here*/
}
```

[Picture Srcset not working?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39236087/html5-picture-element-does-not-seem-to-be-supported-by-chrome-52-srcset-not-wor/71893074#71893074)

- <strong>Tip 1 </strong>: The img element inside the picture element isn't optional. The picture wrapper and its source elements are there to change the img, not replace it.

- <strong>Tip 2 </strong>: You must set a max-width for the lower width image, otherwise it is the only one always served (you can see it in devtools network tab if you try).

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 992px)" srcset="large.jpg" />
  <source media="(max-width: 991px)" srcset="medium.jpg" />
  <img src="small.jpg" alt="" />
</picture>
```

## [Text alternatives for images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/)

Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. This ensures that images can be used by people with various disabilities.

## [Del Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_del.asp)

[What is del tag in HTML?](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-del-tag-in-html)

The del tag in HTML is used to strike a line through a text segment to indicate it has been deleted. It is used to indicate information that has been updated or is no longer accurate.

```html
<del> Strike off text </del>
```
